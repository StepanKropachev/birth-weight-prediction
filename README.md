# Birth Weight Prediction

This was Kaggle ['Prediction interval competition'](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/prediction-interval-competition-i-birth-weight/overview) by Kaggle grandmaster Carl McBride Ellis. 

*Goal: To obtain the minimum average prediction interval.*

In regression, it is not unusual to focus on what is called point predictions (representing central tendency). However, in this competition we are interested in producing a prediction interval (an indication of dispersion). Our task is to create a regression model having the narrowest (most "efficient") overall prediction intervals

Here I also endeavour to work with Optuna, Catboost and Mapie to achieve the best performance. My rank in this competition is 60/92.
